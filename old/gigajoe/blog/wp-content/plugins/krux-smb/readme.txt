Increase traffic, engage users, and improve revenue with easy-to-install social tools that give you control of your audience data.

== Description ==

= Krux Social =

Expand reach and engagement by leveraging your users' network of friends on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, and LinkedIn.

* Easy to install
* No negative impact on page load performance
* Trusted, safe, and secure
* Identify influencers and popular referral sources with real-time reports

= Why data-safe matters =

There are many options out there for social sharing, but many website owners don’t realize that most social widget providers offer such tools only in exchange for valuable information about your users. ’Free’ social sharing tools come at a price – leaked data that social sharing companies use to build user databases to power their own ad targeting businesses. Sometimes, they even sell the data without compensating the websites from which they mined it.

At Krux, we think that's bad for your users and bad for you. Through Krux Social, we give you data-safe solutions for social sharing. You own the data - not someone else - and put it to work yourself to improve your own business.

= Free real-time analytics =

The good news doesn't stop here. We've included real-time analytics that include the following details. And, watch for more coming soon.

* Social activity: social sharing and referral activity for Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, and LinkedIn
* Loyalty: new users, occasionals, regulars and fans
