  <h2>Who We Are</h2><p class="first">We began our careers working in a large Philadelphia insurance defense firm. We concentrated our practices defending major corporations and insurance companies against liability.  We honed our courtroom skills and battled for our clients.  While we are indebted for the invaluable experience, defending insurance companies was simply not the work we believed in.  We were on the wrong side.  </p>
  <p class="first">When we attended law school years ago, we imagined a focused, aggressive law firm with an open door.  We imagined a practice dedicated to helping ordinary people with ordinary (or not so ordinary) problems.  We were determined to fight for the victim that was hit by a reckless driver; the mother who slipped and fell while grocery shopping; the homeowners that were bullied by their insurance company after their home was damaged; and the individual who developed a medical condition after a receiving a routine flu shot.  </p>
  <p class="first">We are experienced attorneys and have litigated an array of motor vehicle accidents, slip and falls, workers compensation claims and insurance coverage matters.   We spent years working for insurance companies and have become well-versed in defense strategies and tactics.  Consequently, we know how to beat the insurance companies; we know the weak spots in their defenses and we are well-versed in the strategies that can beat them.</p>
  <h2>Who We Help</h2><h1>Homeowners & Business Owners</h1><p class="first">You suffered damage to your home, property or business.  The insurance company determined that your damage was not covered or undervalued your loss.  Insurance companies can be wrong.  We will review and analyze your insurance policy to determine whether you are entitled to receive money from the insurance company and fight for the damages to which you are legally entitled.  </p>
  <h1>Accident Victims</h1><p class="first">You were injured in a car accident, slip and fall incident, by a misdiagnosis or mistake by your healthcare professional or in some other fashion.  You may be entitled for compensation for your medical treatment and pain and suffering.  We offer free consultation to determine the facts and legal implications of your particular accident and determine the best course of action to maximize your recovery.  </p>
  <h1>Injured Workers</h1><p class="first">You were injured at work.  It does not matter whose fault it was.  If you are injured at work, and you are unable to work, you are entitled to workers' compensation payments benefits.  Your employer is obligated to pay your medical bills and send you weekly disability checks.  We will ensure   </p>
  <p class="first">We serve clients throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with offices in Philadelphia and Scranton.  If transportation is an issue, we will come to you.</p>
