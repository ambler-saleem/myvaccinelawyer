    <p class="first">Muller Brazil, LLP is a full-service law firm dedicated to achieving the best possible results for our clients. Our Philadelphia personal injury law firm specializes in all areas of personal injury, workers compensation, social security disability, insurance coverage & bad faith, vaccine injuries, and wills & estates.</p>
    <p class="first">Muller Brazil is differentiated from other Philadelphia law firms by our constant dedication and availability to our clients. The foundation of our success is the quality relationships that we develop and maintain with our clients. Each case is important to us, and we are selective about the cases we accept in order to ensure that we are able to devote the time and attention that each client requires and deserves. If you choose to hire Muller Brazil to handle your lawsuit, you will always be able to speak with the attorney assigned to your case. Understanding how your injury, loss or other legal issue has directly affected your life in every respect helps us build a stronger case for you.</p>
    <p class="first">Muller Brazil is comprised of aggressive, experienced attorneys ready to fight to achieve the best possible results for your case.  Prior to forming Muller Brazil, we spent years working for insurance companies and became well-versed in defense strategies and tactics.  We apply this knowledge to strategize against the insurance defense lawyers.  Additionally, we prepare each case as if it will go to trial. This aggressive approach can encourage substantial out-of-court settlements.  When insurance company lawyers recognize that we are confident in taking a case to trial, they may sweeten their settlement offer in an attempt to avoid courtroom litigation. </p>
    <p class="first">We serve clients throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey. If transportation is an issue, we will come to you.</p>
 <p class="first"> Please contact the experienced attorneys at Muller Brazil today to set up a free initial consultation.</p>
